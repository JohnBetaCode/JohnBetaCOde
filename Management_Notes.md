# **Planning Metodologies**

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
## **[The Tech Leadership Framework](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm)**


Apply the SMART model: The SMART Goals framework helps you to set objectives in a way that is not confusing or vague, giving you a concrete and clear framework to reach your desired outcome. It‚Äôs a straightforward tool, and that‚Äôs why many professionals use SMART to keep their plans in check and track progress as they execute their strategies. The SMART Goal method is also a great way to design growth plans, either professional or personal, creating room to develop a purpose and fulfilling path.

* **S** - Specific: What do you want to accomplish? To be specific, add as many ideas as you can to identify patterns and determine the particular goal you want to pursue. Be careful not to get too broad and instead think about a specific area of focus. As you brainstorm, add sticky notes, move them around the board, and cluster ideas with shapes and frames to stay organized.

* **M** - Measurable: How will you know when you accomplished your goal? Make sure your goals are measurable by adding details, metrics, and performance indicators, making notes of anything you want to track. You can also add more templates to your board like Gantt charts, milestone charts, or action plans to have a more complete overview of a project.

* **A** - Attainable: How can the goal be accomplished? To make your goals attainable, consider splitting them into smaller steps that you prioritize so you can achieve results quickly. And, think about whether the goals are realistic, given constraints like financing.

* **R** - Relevant: Will the goal meet your short- and long-term needs? To ensure your goals are relevant, be sure to align them with your company‚Äôs goals, mission, and vision. You can easily share your goals with leaders to get their input.

* **T** - Timely When will the goal be accomplished? To create timely goals, make sure each one gets assigned a deadline, whether short-term (‚Äúwhat can I do today?‚Äù) or long-term (‚Äúwhat can I do in six months?‚Äù). Time-bounded goals ensure lofty ideas can be broken down into actionable steps and make tracking milestones easier and more efficient.

How do you write a SMART goal? Start writing a specific goal with as much detail as possible. Then, add a measurable action to achieve it, followed by what is needed to accomplish this action and what‚Äôs relevant and might influence your process. Set deadlines and timelines to keep track of your progress to finalize it. Remember, write goals that seem realistic and detailed, so you can easily follow what you are setting out to do.

# **The Management Guideline**

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
## **Pillars For Effective Time Management**

1. **1Ô∏è‚É£ Set clear priorities**: Setting clear priorities helps you focus on what matters most, preventing you from thinking so much about your entire to-do list. As you are not going to do it right now, it only makes you feel overwhelmed. How to do it?

    üìù Quick exercise: MIT (Most Important Task): 
        
    * Just define at the end of the day the first thing you will do the next day, the most critical one, and write it down.
    * Then, every day, first thing in the morning, you just do it. 
    * Remember, first means no email, no slack, no meetings. Just. Do. It. If there is something else on your agenda the first time in the * morning, try to move it and make sure you block that first hour for the subsequent days and weeks.

<br />

2. ‚åõ **Blocking time**: Get back control of your time. You need to focus work on the manager‚Äôs important things: systems design, performance reviews, goal setting‚Ä¶And that focus needs enough time to get into the flow, not just 15 minutes slots spread all over the week!

    üìù Quick exercise:

    * Try to block 3 slots of 2 hours for deep & shallow work (like MIT). That means 15% of your week.
    * Think about moving some 1:1s, avoiding non-critical meetings, or delegating part of your tasks.
    * Try to gain this time in the moments of the day when you feel more productive. Trying to focus for 2 hours in a row immediately after lunch is an impossible mission (did you hear about food comma?)
    * Finally, add a 10-minute buffer after meetings to reorder the notes, write down TODOs, and take a break before the next thing. Change the environment, drink some water, close your eyes and breathe for 1-2 minutes. ‚Äî Don‚Äôt take your phone, walk a bit, and stretch your arms and neck. This will close the chapter and re-energize you for the next one.

<br />

3. üòñ **Distractions**: Do you struggle with managing your attention, energy, and time effectively? Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed and don't have the resources to increase your concentration? If your answer is yes to any question, you might have problems with distractions. But no worries, we all face them ‚Äî even daily! Slack notifications, social media, messages, etc‚Ä¶ are time robbers if not managed properly.

    üìù Quick exercise:

    * Set Do Not Disturb status every time you are focused (like in the blocks of the previous exercise, MIT, lunch, meetings‚Ä¶).
    * Use time management tools to keep focused: The Pomodoro technique can help you.
    * Set a time for communications: messages, emails, etc. 2-3 times per day should be more than enough. If they happen in moments of low focus i.e., after lunch, much better.
    * Set clear expectations by communicating the measures to your team and stakeholders, so they know there will be a delay. Add a way to communicate urgencies (real urgencies!), so they know when they can count on you.

<br />

4. **Avoid multitasking**: Context switching, task switching, multitasking‚Ä¶ whatever you want to call these behaviors, they‚Äôre incredibly hard on your already-taxed brain. And while the immediate costs might feel small, the compounding impact on your productivity is staggering.

    üìù Quick exercise:

    * Get the focus on just one thing, the most important (MIT again), only one at a time. If you complete one task daily, at the end of the week you will have completed the 5 most important tasks.

<br />

5. On Friday, at the end of the day, ask yourself:

    * How productive do you feel, from 1 to 10?
    * How would you evaluate your focus, from 1 to 10?
    * How much control over your agenda do you feel you have, from 1 to 10?
    * Compare the results with the values written on Monday
    * Propose 3 measures to increase the values by 1 point
    * Repeat next week!  üåÄ

## **The Framework for Conducting Successful Performance Reviews**

A fundamental and constant task you should carry out is evaluating the performance of your collaborators. 

* ‚úèÔ∏è **Prepare the foundations**: To define the foundations, it is very important to start with the career ladder, setting those expectations and clarity that are held within each role on the engineering ladder. Define what performance means for the company, and ask yourself what metrics, behaviors, OKRs, competencies, and even cultural values you want to evaluate.

* üõê **Evangelize your team**: We are not prepared to give or receive feedback, and it is usually something we are not taught in our environment. So you, as a leader,  should train your team to give that feedback in the right way. Likewise, your team must be clear about the evaluation process. Who does it? What is the format? What is the objective pursued when carrying out these 360 evaluations?

* üìä **Reunite & Refine data**: Take the time to understand and comprehend the data. Evaluate what metrics, behaviors, facts, and values you can extract from the exercise. Does the evaluation correspond to reality? Are there biases that can affect the reading of the results?

* üíØ **Formalize the results**: Establish a format to present the data to your collaborators and evaluate it with them. How to transmit the message? Connect conclusions with data points or situations. Share with your direct report the good performance,  where she failed but also how she can grow. Remember that communication is in 2 ways, you and her. Ask questions that will help you understand the results even better, and take the time to listen actively. Challenge her to keep growing and turn feedback into actionable next steps.

* ‚è© **Follow Up constantly**: Create a follow-up plan, run regular 1:1s with your collaborators and add two key ingredients to make this a long-term successful process: Training and challenges.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
## **The Constructive Feedback to your Tech Team**

Most common mistakes:

* It is not concrete or clear about why we were doing that task ( affected motivation).
* Don't give freedom or autonomy.
* Dodn't celebrate milestones and only looked at what must be improve.
* Share critiques in public ‚Äî at team meetings, and do not wait to say what it's felt at that moment.

When you become a manager, you have to understand how to deliver the message properly and turn feedback into actionable next steps. However, It's not easy to do it when you don't have any proper training, practice, or even a framework you can follow, taking the risk of falling into two very common mistakes:

‚ùå Giving feedback so soft and indirect that your collaborator doesn't even recognize that he/she is receiving feedback and ignore it. 

‚ùå Or otherwise, being so direct to the point that your employee takes a defensive position.

1. Ask for permission ü§î

    Start by asking permission from the other person. ¬´Do you have a couple of minutes? I have some ideas to improve the process¬ª ¬´I want to tell you something about the performance of the meeting, can we talk?¬ª
    These types of questions will anticipate to your collaborator's brain that there is feedback to come and, thus, create a moment of acceptance and autonomy.

2. Implement the SBI framework model üìã

    * [ùó¶] Situation: Define when and where the situation happened. Be as specific as possible. 
    * [ùóï] Behavior: Describe how that behavior occurred objectively and specifically. Keep to the facts, and don't insert opinions or judgments.
    * [ùóú] Impact: Show the impact of the person's behavior on you, your team, and the organization.

3. End with a question ‚ùì

    * ¬´What do you think about it?¬ª 
    * ¬´I consider we should do this, but what do you think?¬ª
    
    Closing with a bouncing question will turn the situation into a joint problem-solving moment where your collaborator also has the chance to share her opinion and decision.

It will create commitment on her part rather than compliance. Managers also have room for improvement.

Those who know how to give proper feedback also ask for it regularly.

As a manager, you also have things to improve, so the recommendatiob is asking for constant feedback from your team members. ‚Äî It will help you set up a better continuous improvement process and achieve higher performance.

## **One on One's**

* üëâ I did 1:1s without prior preparation, not knowing what to say or how to empower the meeting.
* üëâ I had a hard time learning the different personalities of my team members.
* üëâ I got frustrated because I really enjoyed coding, but I didn't have much time to do it with all my new functions. ‚Äî  But, I neither understood that my technical skill should evolve to provide a whole vision of the system to make accurate technical decisions.
* üëâ Last but not least, all the insecurity I felt of not having clarity on what to do, besides having the impostor syndrome all the time!!!!!

Promote growth and mobility: Workers are increasingly eager to see opportunities for learning, development, and advancement in their workplace. In addition, recent research from Cornell University‚Äôs School of Industrial and Labor Relations shows that those who have moved internally within a company not only tend to be high performers but are also more likely to stay with the organization over time. In fact, the highest performing internal hires tend to stay the longest. While it is important to note that while some employees are looking for promotions, research suggests that many are not necessarily interested in additional work and responsibilities. Rather, they are simply seeking new challenges and the chance to explore something different. According to the MIT Sloan Review, lateral career opportunities are 12x more predictive of employee retention than promotions. So, to create a meaningful work experience for your employees, give them opportunities for growth, movement, and the development of new skills.

Build relationships: When employees feel they belong, they are 3.5x more likely to contribute to their full potential and are significantly more likely to feel connected to their work, according to research from the Harvard Business Review. That‚Äôs why company-organized social events, like happy hours, team-building excursions, dinners, and other fun activities outside the workplace are a great way to promote a healthy corporate culture, help your team members connect to each other, and increase their sense of belonging at work.

Give your employees a voice: Employees tend to feel more connected to their work when they have a real voice on the team ‚Äì the ability to influence decisions and processes. IBM research found that 90% of workers said that they are likely to stay at a company that takes and acts on their feedback. So, whenever possible, give your employees the chance to contribute their ideas, encourage them to take ownership, and involve them in decision-making processes.

Convey impact: When employees recognize the impact of their day-to-day activities, they are much more likely to find their work meaningful. So, take the time to help your team members understand how their role connects to your company's mission and values. It can be useful to share relevant customer testimonials with your team to highlight the ways in which their efforts are affecting others and helping the company achieve its goals.

## Imposter Syndrome: The most frequent visitor when you become a manager üíä


* ‚úÖ The first thing to do if you want to become a great leader, is to address those insecurities first. Talk to your manager and your team, be vulnerable, and don‚Äôt keep them just for yourself. You will learn that many of the assumptions about the future only live in your mind. And they could also tell you what they expect, so you avoid the perfectionism trap.

* ‚úÖ Get a mentor to discuss your fears or insecurities. She will help you to set an action plan to overcome them based on her experience dealing with similar situations, and that pair of fresh eyes could be the objective perspective you are missing to balance your thoughts. It‚Äôs accelerated growth.

* ‚úÖ Ask your mentor, manager, or team for feedback about your performance. They could also give you tips, examples, or resources to improve. Ask for help.

* ‚úÖ Reflect on your goals achieved... DAILY, even if you think they are "insignificant‚Äù. Especially those that were hard to reach. When you come back to everything you have achieved over a longer period, i.e. one year, it will be easier for you to celebrate and gain confidence. Don‚Äôt just look above the ladder, only to find out how far you are from the top. That will always be moving. ‚Äî  Instead, take some time regularly to look below and see how far you are now from the ground.

* ‚úÖ Compare yourself‚Ä¶ but only with yourself. Today you are BETTER than yesterday! That‚Äôs the one and the only thing that matters, and what you need to ask yourself every night. Don‚Äôt waste your time comparing yourself to others, it will never be a fair comparison, and it will make you feel worse. Instead, invest that time and energy wisely working on your improvement.

* ‚úÖ Do the exercise of writing good things about yourself on paper, so you don't forget them. ‚Äî Not only those you perceive, but also think about those moments in which someone else told you something good, and you did not value it.

* ‚úÖ Don't stop doing new things! ‚Äî Do things that are a challenge for you, things that involve leaving your comfort zone. Things that scare you and imply a change. Whatever it is, dare! Only then can you understand that you have much more capacity than you think to face the new and unknown.

Managers are role models in every aspect, whether we like it or not. You have a huge impact on the lives of every single member of your team (and beyond), but that can backfire if the model is not the right one. If you stay until 20:00, don't expect them to react to your policy that they should leave early. If you don‚Äôt prioritize your own learning and growth, don‚Äôt expect them to be proactive when choosing courses or training.

## **A Framework to Resolve Conflicts Within Your Tech Team**


A problem many managers face, especially new leaders, is **working out how to solve conflicts** between team members.

Let's start from the beginning. Human beings act out of necessity. **We are social animals** interacting with other people to share, give what other person needs, and feel secure. But sometimes, we are selfish. Nothing wrong with that; it is a person's natural behavior. 
Although being selfish is natural, we should be careful about balancing our relationships, especially in our company.

We all give and take, **and relationships have to be in balance**. Balance in a relationship is defined by both parts: you and your teammates.

**When there is an imbalance, conflict happens.** That's essentially a conflict: the perception for someone that the exchange is not fair and are not getting the needs they want from that relationship.

**How to resolve them efficiently?**

1. Find out the imbalance and identify the problem. 

    Your job as a manager is to find out what causes the imbalance and how to fix it, ask questions, and dig down.

    What's the need that is not being matched? This is the key to finding out how to solve conflicts.

2. Find out if you are responsible for it.

    We, as managers, are not the saviors of the world.

    When resolving a conflict, you must evaluate if it affects the team's goal: If it doesn't, step aside and let it go! But if it does, you must step in and fix it.

3. Make decisions following the proper order

    Every system needs an order to survive ‚Äî understanding that a system is a group of people with a common goal. e.g., your team, the company.

    You are responsible for making decisions, so the system stays alive for as long as possible.

    It's recommended to you to make decisions following this order:

        Leader < Individual < Team < Company 

    A person is less important than a team and less important than a bigger system: the company.

    For every decision, think first about the benefits of the biggest system.

    * "Is this the best decision for the company?" If it's not, it's a wrong decision. The company pays you to deliver results.

    * "Is this the best decision for the company and the team?" A better decision.

4. Prepare the process to prevent this kind of conflict from happening again

    Every time you get a conflict, take it as an opportunity to learn.

    Once the conflict is partially solved, run follow-ups in your 1:1s sessions to get the main takeaways from both parties, and don't forget to take action to prevent this issue from happening again.

## **Teaching is the most effective way to learn**

Has it happened to you that you have found the solution to a programming problem and your manager asks you to share that knowledge with the rest of the team so that they can learn from this experience?

At that point you are forced to think in clear, concise terms about the solution you found, the design patterns you used, and the process you followed from start to finish.

You organize your ideas, ask yourself questions, clarify concepts, look for external support resources, take screenshots of the code... You invest extra time in preparation, but, in the end, you are aware that you have more mastery of the subject, you are more fluent: you have delved into the concept and you have internalized it. Now you are more expert.

Surely you already knew this, but what you probably don't know is WHY?

* When we teach someone, we are forced to organize our thoughts and explain concepts more clearly and concisely.

* We can also receive feedback and questions that force us to deepen our knowledge, helping us to discover new interesting aspects of the subject we are teaching or other points of view, expanding our understanding of it.

Rather than just reading or listening to information, teaching forces us to put what we've learned into practice, and this is especially helpful when it comes to skills that require a lot of practice like programming, people management, and soft skills.

The pyramid of experience, a pedagogical model classifies the effectiveness of different forms of learning in terms of retention after 2 weeks. x
