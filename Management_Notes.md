# **Planning Metodologies**

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
## **[The Tech Leadership Framework](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm)**


Apply the SMART model: The SMART Goals framework helps you to set objectives in a way that is not confusing or vague, giving you a concrete and clear framework to reach your desired outcome. It‚Äôs a straightforward tool, and that‚Äôs why many professionals use SMART to keep their plans in check and track progress as they execute their strategies. The SMART Goal method is also a great way to design growth plans, either professional or personal, creating room to develop a purpose and fulfilling path.

* **S** - Specific: What do you want to accomplish? To be specific, add as many ideas as you can to identify patterns and determine the particular goal you want to pursue. Be careful not to get too broad and instead think about a specific area of focus. As you brainstorm, add sticky notes, move them around the board, and cluster ideas with shapes and frames to stay organized.

* **M** - Measurable: How will you know when you accomplished your goal? Make sure your goals are measurable by adding details, metrics, and performance indicators, making notes of anything you want to track. You can also add more templates to your board like Gantt charts, milestone charts, or action plans to have a more complete overview of a project.

* **A** - Attainable: How can the goal be accomplished? To make your goals attainable, consider splitting them into smaller steps that you prioritize so you can achieve results quickly. And, think about whether the goals are realistic, given constraints like financing.

* **R** - Relevant: Will the goal meet your short- and long-term needs? To ensure your goals are relevant, be sure to align them with your company‚Äôs goals, mission, and vision. You can easily share your goals with leaders to get their input.

* **T** - Timely When will the goal be accomplished? To create timely goals, make sure each one gets assigned a deadline, whether short-term (‚Äúwhat can I do today?‚Äù) or long-term (‚Äúwhat can I do in six months?‚Äù). Time-bounded goals ensure lofty ideas can be broken down into actionable steps and make tracking milestones easier and more efficient.

How do you write a SMART goal? Start writing a specific goal with as much detail as possible. Then, add a measurable action to achieve it, followed by what is needed to accomplish this action and what‚Äôs relevant and might influence your process. Set deadlines and timelines to keep track of your progress to finalize it. Remember, write goals that seem realistic and detailed, so you can easily follow what you are setting out to do.

# **The Management Guideline**

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
## **Pillars For Effective Time Management**

1. **1Ô∏è‚É£ Set clear priorities**: Setting clear priorities helps you focus on what matters most, preventing you from thinking so much about your entire to-do list. As you are not going to do it right now, it only makes you feel overwhelmed. How to do it?

    üìù Quick exercise: MIT (Most Important Task): 
        
    * Just define at the end of the day the first thing you will do the next day, the most critical one, and write it down.
    * Then, every day, first thing in the morning, you just do it. 
    * Remember, first means no email, no slack, no meetings. Just. Do. It. If there is something else on your agenda the first time in the * morning, try to move it and make sure you block that first hour for the subsequent days and weeks.

<br />

2. ‚åõ **Blocking time**: Get back control of your time. You need to focus work on the manager‚Äôs important things: systems design, performance reviews, goal setting‚Ä¶And that focus needs enough time to get into the flow, not just 15 minutes slots spread all over the week!

    üìù Quick exercise:

    * Try to block 3 slots of 2 hours for deep & shallow work (like MIT). That means 15% of your week.
    * Think about moving some 1:1s, avoiding non-critical meetings, or delegating part of your tasks.
    * Try to gain this time in the moments of the day when you feel more productive. Trying to focus for 2 hours in a row immediately after lunch is an impossible mission (did you hear about food comma?)
    * Finally, add a 10-minute buffer after meetings to reorder the notes, write down TODOs, and take a break before the next thing. Change the environment, drink some water, close your eyes and breathe for 1-2 minutes. ‚Äî Don‚Äôt take your phone, walk a bit, and stretch your arms and neck. This will close the chapter and re-energize you for the next one.

<br />

3. üòñ **Distractions**: Do you struggle with managing your attention, energy, and time effectively? Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed and don't have the resources to increase your concentration? If your answer is yes to any question, you might have problems with distractions. But no worries, we all face them ‚Äî even daily! Slack notifications, social media, messages, etc‚Ä¶ are time robbers if not managed properly.

    üìù Quick exercise:

    * Set Do Not Disturb status every time you are focused (like in the blocks of the previous exercise, MIT, lunch, meetings‚Ä¶).
    * Use time management tools to keep focused: The Pomodoro technique can help you.
    * Set a time for communications: messages, emails, etc. 2-3 times per day should be more than enough. If they happen in moments of low focus i.e., after lunch, much better.
    * Set clear expectations by communicating the measures to your team and stakeholders, so they know there will be a delay. Add a way to communicate urgencies (real urgencies!), so they know when they can count on you.

<br />

4. **Avoid multitasking**: Context switching, task switching, multitasking‚Ä¶ whatever you want to call these behaviors, they‚Äôre incredibly hard on your already-taxed brain. And while the immediate costs might feel small, the compounding impact on your productivity is staggering.

    üìù Quick exercise:

    * Get the focus on just one thing, the most important (MIT again), only one at a time. If you complete one task daily, at the end of the week you will have completed the 5 most important tasks.

<br />

5. On Friday, at the end of the day, ask yourself:

    * How productive do you feel, from 1 to 10?
    * How would you evaluate your focus, from 1 to 10?
    * How much control over your agenda do you feel you have, from 1 to 10?
    * Compare the results with the values written on Monday
    * Propose 3 measures to increase the values by 1 point
    * Repeat next week!  üåÄ

# **Work Relationships**

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
## **The Framework for Conducting Successful Performance Reviews**

A fundamental and constant task you should carry out is evaluating the performance of your collaborators. 

* ‚úèÔ∏è **Prepare the foundations**: To define the foundations, it is very important to start with the career ladder, setting those expectations and clarity that are held within each role on the engineering ladder. Define what performance means for the company, and ask yourself what metrics, behaviors, OKRs, competencies, and even cultural values you want to evaluate.

* üõê **Evangelize your team**: We are not prepared to give or receive feedback, and it is usually something we are not taught in our environment. So you, as a leader,  should train your team to give that feedback in the right way. Likewise, your team must be clear about the evaluation process. Who does it? What is the format? What is the objective pursued when carrying out these 360 evaluations?

* üìä **Reunite & Refine data**: Take the time to understand and comprehend the data. Evaluate what metrics, behaviors, facts, and values you can extract from the exercise. Does the evaluation correspond to reality? Are there biases that can affect the reading of the results?

* üíØ **Formalize the results**: Establish a format to present the data to your collaborators and evaluate it with them. How to transmit the message? Connect conclusions with data points or situations. Share with your direct report the good performance,  where she failed but also how she can grow. Remember that communication is in 2 ways, you and her. Ask questions that will help you understand the results even better, and take the time to listen actively. Challenge her to keep growing and turn feedback into actionable next steps.

* ‚è© **Follow Up constantly**: Create a follow-up plan, run regular 1:1s with your collaborators and add two key ingredients to make this a long-term successful process: Training and challenges.

<!-- ************************************************************************************************************************************ -->

## **The Constructive Feedback to your Tech Team**

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

Most common mistakes:

* It is not concrete or clear about why we were doing that task ( affected motivation).
* Don't give freedom or autonomy.
* Don't celebrate milestones and only looked at what must be improve.
* Share critiques in public ‚Äî at team meetings, and do not wait to say what it's felt at that moment.

When you become a manager, you have to understand how to deliver the message properly and turn feedback into actionable next steps. However, It's not easy to do it when you don't have any proper training, practice, or even a framework you can follow, taking the risk of falling into two very common mistakes:

* ‚ùå Giving feedback so soft and indirect that your collaborator doesn't even recognize that he/she is receiving feedback and ignore it. 

* ‚ùå Or otherwise, being so direct to the point that your employee takes a defensive position.

1. Ask for permission

    Start by asking permission from the other person. ¬´Do you have a couple of minutes? I have some ideas to improve the process¬ª ¬´I want to tell you something about the performance of the meeting, can we talk?¬ª
    These types of questions will anticipate to your collaborator's brain that there is feedback to come and, thus, create a moment of acceptance and autonomy.

2. Implement the SBI framework model:

[ùó¶] Situation: Define when and where the situation happened. Be as specific as possible. 
[ùóï] Behavior: Describe how that behavior occurred objectively and specifically. Keep to the facts, and don't insert opinions or judgments.
[ùóú] Impact: Show the impact of the person's behavior on you, your team, and the organization.

3. End with a question

¬´What do you think about it?¬ª 
¬´I consider we should do this, but what do you think?¬ª
Closing with a bouncing question will turn the situation into a joint problem-solving moment where your collaborator also has the chance to share her opinion and decision.
It will create commitment on her part rather than compliance.

Managers also have room for improvement.

Those who know how to give proper feedback also ask for it regularly.

As a manager, you also have things to improve, so I recommend you to ask for constant feedback from your team members. ‚Äî It will help you set up a better continuous improvement process and achieve higher performance.

## **Best practices to build an engineering culture where everyone can thrive üíä**


<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

Culture is the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind every action taken by anyone. Those infinite, small actions are what ultimately determine success.

* ‚ùå  **Not working well enough with the team to maintain effective communication**. The fact that the founders and the team are in different time zones without being prepared caused communication to be lost. 

* ‚ùå  **lose trust in the team**, and lose on you, as no longer talking on a personal level ‚Äì getting the work process to suffer. The planning, prioritization, time management, everything could be affected, and therefore the delivery of the team is slower and with less quality. 

* ‚ö†Ô∏è **A toxic culture is easily noticed**: Communication is not assertive, teams are not synced, managers spend much time micromanaging, and the trust and motivation of the team are reduced. But‚Ä¶ A good engineering culture is extremely valuable! Besides keeping your developers close, It sets everyone up for success and holds the team accountable for its stated goals

* üí® **Culture is a set of practices and behaviors in a company's operation** It's something you experience daily; it's the air you breathe in the company; it's your engineers working happily and healthily, doing meaningful work, and growing professionally and personally. However, achieving a good engineering culture is not something simple, nor is there a single way to achieve it. It all depends on you and the company. But, what exists are good practices you should keep in mind when implementing a culture within your team


### üëâ **Reflect on your company values**

Fostering a good engineering culture is part of the values ‚Äã‚Äãand beliefs of the company and the team members.

    Reflect on the most important beliefs to your team and opt for actionable values. ‚Äî i.e., collaboration, transparency, continuous improvement, etc.

And here‚Äôs something important:  If you say something is important to you and you‚Äôd like the rest of your team to care about it, be the first person to live that value. Otherwise, don‚Äôt be surprised when nobody else does either. 

### **üëâ Start with you** 

Culture & Values are all about living them. Walk the walk, and lead by example.  

If you want to ground a certain culture, you must always be the first to lead by example. Your behavior must align with the behaviors and values you would like your team to adopt.

* If you want people to have a good work-life balance and you don't want them to work late, you can't send them an email late. 

* If you want your direct reports to be well prepared and run their 1:1, you must be the first to prepare YOUR 1:1 with your manager. 

You are a referent for your team, and you will be imitated whether you are a role model or not. 

### **üëâ Foster Autonomy** 

The most effective leaders build a team culture based on autonomy to achieve their expectations.

Fostering autonomy in your engineers will make them go from being accountable for their responsibilities to wanting to be accountable, as they will begin to acquire and own their initiatives. 

Your role as a manager is to facilitate mastery, so they can put it into practice autonomously.  As well as facilitate an environment in which they can make decisions and accept failure as part of the learning, and process to be more autonomous.

### **üëâ Trust & Transparency**

Transparency by default, is a key value. Try to keep everything as open as possible with the team. eg. use Notion as documentation center, so everyone can access it, thus fostering trust and transparency.

Another example of transparency is to have your engineering career ladder accessible from a well-known location.

It should NOT be a mystery how to get promoted in the company, and the standards should be universally applicable. It hurts your culture if someone can be promoted by achieving less in a different group; it can create a "toxic" culture that you definitely don't want.

### **üëâ Encourage assertive communication**

Last but not least, encourage communication as effective and assertive as possible. It has a HUGE impact on your team's experience, motivation, trust, and commitment.

When teams communicate effectively,  they can create goals and outcomes that more members agree on, promoting better teamwork. 

    Culture eats strategy for breakfast. 

Keep it as one of your key priorities at all times

Culture is the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind every action taken by anyone. Those infinite, small actions are what ultimately determine success.

## **Using assertiveness when leading tech teams**

Communication is one of the most important skills to develop in any career, but above all, one of the key skills to succeed in leadership roles.

However, effective communication implies assertive communication. ‚Äî A key component for engineering leaders: Say the right thing at the right time, in the right way.

Being assertive allows us to express our opinions, needs and feelings without ignoring or harming the opinions, needs, and others' feelings.

### **üìô What is Assertiveness**

The Oxford Dictionary defines it as follows: 

    ‚Äúthe quality of expressing opinions or desires in a strong and confident way, so that people take notice‚Äù

Although this expression falls short, it lacks the best part of the definition. Expressing opinions assertively includes at least two characteristics, that the sender does not give up his or her principles or internal standards, and that the receiver does not feel that his or her own is being invaded. 

A better definition is included in Dorland's Medical Dictionary:

    ‚Äúa form of behavior characterized by a confident declaration or affirmation of a statement without need of proof; this affirms the person's rights or point of view without either aggressively threatening the rights of another (assuming a position of dominance) or submissively permitting another to ignore or deny one's rights or point of view‚Äù.

### **üîë What is the key?**

In our language and actions, assertiveness helps us respect the rights of others. Although assertiveness is bidirectional.

### **‚úÖ Using assertiveness when leading teams**

Effective communication helps to detect problems before they grow, to handle incidents in their early stages, and not when the fire is raging out of control.

In order to communicate assertively, one has to change the paradigm. So far, when leading teams, we have been told about the importance of transmitting charisma, leadership, and strength in our words. ‚Äî But how do the receivers, our teammates, whether they are subordinates or not, feel about our communication? 

Instead of starting a sentence by saying "I want you to give top priority to this task", we could rephrase it in its assertive stream "I think this task has a higher priority, what do you think?". 

At first glance, it may seem like a disadvantage, the second option forces a conversation, while the first is an imperative statement.

### **üó£Ô∏è Benefits of implementing assertive language**

As managers, using assertive communication with the team will keep the lines of communication always open, a team or worker who feels respected, will be willing to express themselves freely.

<!-- 
üëâ I did 1:1s without prior preparation, not knowing what to say or how to empower the meeting.
üëâ I had a hard time learning the different personalities of my team members.
üëâ I got frustrated because I really enjoyed coding, but I didn't have much time to do it with all my new functions. ‚Äî  But, I neither understood that my technical skill should evolve to provide a whole vision of the system to make accurate technical decisions.
üëâ Last but not least, all the insecurity I felt of not having clarity on what to do, besides having the impostor syndrome all the time!!!!!

Promote growth and mobility: Workers are increasingly eager to see opportunities for learning, development, and advancement in their workplace. In addition, recent research from Cornell University‚Äôs School of Industrial and Labor Relations shows that those who have moved internally within a company not only tend to be high performers but are also more likely to stay with the organization over time. In fact, the highest performing internal hires tend to stay the longest. While it is important to note that while some employees are looking for promotions, research suggests that many are not necessarily interested in additional work and responsibilities. Rather, they are simply seeking new challenges and the chance to explore something different. According to the MIT Sloan Review, lateral career opportunities are 12x more predictive of employee retention than promotions. So, to create a meaningful work experience for your employees, give them opportunities for growth, movement, and the development of new skills.

Build relationships: When employees feel they belong, they are 3.5x more likely to contribute to their full potential and are significantly more likely to feel connected to their work, according to research from the Harvard Business Review. That‚Äôs why company-organized social events, like happy hours, team-building excursions, dinners, and other fun activities outside the workplace are a great way to promote a healthy corporate culture, help your team members connect to each other, and increase their sense of belonging at work.

Give your employees a voice: Employees tend to feel more connected to their work when they have a real voice on the team ‚Äì the ability to influence decisions and processes. IBM research found that 90% of workers said that they are likely to stay at a company that takes and acts on their feedback. So, whenever possible, give your employees the chance to contribute their ideas, encourage them to take ownership, and involve them in decision-making processes.

Convey impact: When employees recognize the impact of their day-to-day activities, they are much more likely to find their work meaningful. So, take the time to help your team members understand how their role connects to your company's mission and values. It can be useful to share relevant customer testimonials with your team to highlight the ways in which their efforts are affecting others and helping the company achieve its goals.

Imposter Syndrome: The most frequent visitor when you become a manager üíä

‚úÖ The first thing to do if you want to become a great leader, is to address those insecurities first. Talk to your manager and your team, be vulnerable, and don‚Äôt keep them just for yourself. You will learn that many of the assumptions about the future only live in your mind. And they could also tell you what they expect, so you avoid the perfectionism trap.

‚úÖ Get a mentor to discuss your fears or insecurities. She will help you to set an action plan to overcome them based on her experience dealing with similar situations, and that pair of fresh eyes could be the objective perspective you are missing to balance your thoughts. It‚Äôs accelerated growth.

‚úÖ Ask your mentor, manager, or team for feedback about your performance. They could also give you tips, examples, or resources to improve. Ask for help.

‚úÖ Reflect on your goals achieved... DAILY, even if you think they are "insignificant‚Äù. Especially those that were hard to reach. When you come back to everything you have achieved over a longer period, i.e. one year, it will be easier for you to celebrate and gain confidence. Don‚Äôt just look above the ladder, only to find out how far you are from the top. That will always be moving. ‚Äî  Instead, take some time regularly to look below and see how far you are now from the ground.

‚úÖ Compare yourself‚Ä¶ but only with yourself. Today you are BETTER than yesterday! That‚Äôs the one and the only thing that matters, and what you need to ask yourself every night. Don‚Äôt waste your time comparing yourself to others, it will never be a fair comparison, and it will make you feel worse. Instead, invest that time and energy wisely working on your improvement.

‚úÖ Do the exercise of writing good things about yourself on paper, so you don't forget them. ‚Äî Not only those you perceive, but also think about those moments in which someone else told you something good, and you did not value it.

‚úÖ Don't stop doing new things! ‚Äî Do things that are a challenge for you, things that involve leaving your comfort zone. Things that scare you and imply a change. Whatever it is, dare! Only then can you understand that you have much more capacity than you think to face the new and unknown.

Managers are role models in every aspect, whether we like it or not. You have a huge impact on the lives of every single member of your team (and beyond), but that can backfire if the model is not the right one. If you stay until 20:00, don't expect them to react to your policy that they should leave early. If you don‚Äôt prioritize your own learning and growth, don‚Äôt expect them to be proactive when choosing courses or training.

Losing someone is a chance to find someone better, stronger, and more agile. Loses are new opportunities.
